                <h1>Why you Should Prepare for the Zombie Apocalypse</h1>

                <h2>You Have Intense Hankerings for Freeze Dried Goods</h2>
                <p>Who doesn't love the freeze dried ice cream of your science center visiting youth.  did you know there is a who plethora of freeze dried goods ready to take you through the next 25 years of zombie stockpiling?  Why not stock up (and sample along the way):

                <ol>
                    <li>Dried Fruit</li>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Strawberries</li>
                        <li>Blueberries</li>
                        <li>Grapes</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Dried Veggies</li>
                    <li>Dried Stews (mmmmmm) <img src="img/smiley.gif" alt=smiley face width="32" height="32"></li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Let's Face It: Unpredictability</h2>

                <p>Even if the zombies don't come and take over or the current zombie set do not dramatically affect the day to day, why not prepare for the unexpected? Get crazy! Put up a fence? Stockpile like you are the only store for miles.  Buy that solar powered system you have been wanting forever but could not find the funds to justify.  In fact, you can justify all debt incurrance with the collapse of the fiat system.</p>

                <h2>Be a Rebel</h2>

                <p>This is your chance to <b>rebel against the system</b>.  You know you want to.</p>
